uncertainty type	name	description	reference
1	random	Random uncertainties are the uncertainty contributions due to random effects causing random errors that cannot be corrected for in a single measured value, even in principle, because the effect is stochastic
2	systematic	Systematic uncertainties are the uncertainty contributions due to systematic effects which, although they can be corrected in principle, cannot be corrected in practice. In other words, systematic uncertainties are statistical characterizations, by means of distributions of possible values of the measurand, of those systematic errors which, although removable in principle, cannot be corrected in practice
3	quasisystematic	The quasisystematic uncertainties are related to the estimates of errors which behave in a consistent way between measurements over a time period similar to that over which measurements are recorded.
4	structured random	The structured random uncertainty is a contribution systematic over one timescale and / or space scale, but effectively random over longer space and / or timescales.
5	total	The total uncertainty is the sum in quadrature of all the contributions (systematic, quasi-systematic and statistical) to the uncertainty budget.
6	ozone partial pressure total	Total uncertainty in the calculation of the ozone partial pressure as a composite of the individual uncertainties contribution. Uncertainties due to systamtic bias are assumed as random and following a random normal distribution. The uncertainty calculation also accounts for the increased uncertainty incurred by homogenizing the data record.
7	ozone partial pressure percentage	Percentage total uncertainty in the calculation of the ozone partial pressure as a composite of the individual uncertainties contribution. Uncertainties due to systamtic bias are assumed as random and following a random normal distribution. The uncertainty calculation also accounts for the increased uncertainty incurred by homogenizing the data record.
8	negative random	Random uncertainties are the uncertainty contributions due to random effects causing random errors that cannot be corrected for in a single measured value, even in principle, because the effect is stochastic. According to the GUM, while uncertainty is typically expressed as a standard deviation and assumed to be symmetric, it may become asymmetric in cases involving non-linear measurement models or non-Gaussian input distributions.
9	positive random	Random uncertainties are the uncertainty contributions due to random effects causing random errors that cannot be corrected for in a single measured value, even in principle, because the effect is stochastic. According to the GUM, while uncertainty is typically expressed as a standard deviation and assumed to be symmetric, it may become asymmetric in cases involving non-linear measurement models or non-Gaussian input distributions.
10	negative systematic	Systematic errors which, although removable in principle, cannot be corrected in practice. Systematic uncertainties are the uncertainty contributions due to systematic effects which, although they can be corrected in principle, cannot be corrected in practice. In other words, systematic. Negative uncertainty refers to the systematic errors  (correlated in time) which generates a negative bias.
11	positive systematic	Systematic errors which, although removable in principle, cannot be corrected in practice. Systematic uncertainties are the uncertainty contributions due to systematic effects which, although they can be corrected in principle, cannot be corrected in practice. In other words, systematic. Positive uncertainty refers to the systematic errors  (correlated in time) which generates a  positive bias.
12	negative quasisystematic	The quasisystematic uncertainties are related to the estimates of errors which are random at high temporal resolution but they becomes correlated between measurements at smaller resolutions. Negative uncertainty refers to the component correlated in time which generates a negative bias that cannot be corrected in practice.
13	positive quasisystematic	The quasisystematic uncertainties are related to the estimates of errors which are random at high temporal resolution but they becomes correlated between measurements at smaller resolutions. Positive uncertainty refers to the component correlated in time which generates a positive bias that cannot be corrected in practice.
14	negative total	The total uncertainty is the sum in quadrature of all the contributions (systematic, quasi-systematic and statistical) to the uncertainty budget. Negative uncertainty refers to square combination of the random component and the component correlated in time which generates a  negative bias that cannot be corrected in practice.
15	positive total	The total uncertainty is the sum in quadrature of all the contributions (systematic, quasi-systematic and statistical) to the uncertainty budget. Positive uncertainty refers to square combination of the random component and the component correlated in time which generates a positive bias that cannot be corrected in practice."
